        A Counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process
        has occurred, often in relationship to a clock signal. Counters are used in digital electronics for counting
        purpose, they can count specific event happening in the circuit. For example, in UP counter a counter increases
        count for every rising edge of clock. Not only counting, a counter can follow the certain sequence based on our
        design like any random sequence 0,1,3,2â€¦ .They can also be designed with the help of flip flops. They are used
        as frequency dividers where the frequency of given pulse waveform is divided. Counters are sequential circuit
        that count the number of pulses can be either in binary code or BCD form. The main properties of a counter are
        timing , sequencing , and counting. Counter works in two modes
